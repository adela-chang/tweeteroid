Tweeeteroid was created in 2011 as a small programming project for CS160 (User Interface Design). Other projects from the class include Tenant Management Communication and [a small drawing application] (http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs160-sp11/images/e/ea/Adela-Chang-ipa2.wmv) which was later featured in 2013 as [a sample app] (http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs160-sp13/index.php/Individual_Programming_Assignment_2) for the assignment.
