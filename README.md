# Tweeteroid

## Overview
Tweeeteroid was created in 2011 as a small programming project for CS160 (User Interface Design). Other projects from the class include [Tenant Management Communication] (TenManComm) and [a small drawing application] (http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs160-sp11/images/e/ea/Adela-Chang-ipa2.wmv) which was later featured by the professor in 2013 as a sample app for the assignment.

## Demo
